The dataset "Interactions_RII_neighbours_associated" contains the RII values for each performance between associated species "Especes" and their neighbouring species "Espece_Nurse".
Each neighbouring species "Espece_Nurse" owns its canopy measurements: Height "Hauteur", Length "Longueur", Width "Largeur", Density "Densite", Canopy volume "Volume_Canopy".
There are two spatial scales: Sites "Site" (Bolivia "Glacier 10 (BO)", Peru "Uruashraju (PE)", France "GÃ©broulaz (FR)"; and deglaciated area "Deglaciated_area" (0-30 years after glacier retreat "A"; 30-60 years "B").
